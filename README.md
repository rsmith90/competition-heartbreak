# competition-heartbreak
Competition is a registration/check-in for scheduled competitions. Able to utilize a judging/placement components with registered particpants.

Wanting to use: ReactJS/NodeJS (open to learn simplest form)

ABOUT: Second major project, of which i'm attempting to learn encryption/back-end to learn how to communicate information provided to myself as well as other needed participants.

SETUP: a form to gather participant info > (encrypt) > npm for judging system? > create accounts > start/end register date > send registered particpants to host

Allow admin access(host of comp) 
Setup judges accounts 3.

Bonus:
Set up a search list of particpants to place in 2 tourney style = 1 winner interchangeable w/participants. Easy platform for judges to select participants and judge.
